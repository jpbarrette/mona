OpenGL related:
* There's seem to have a problem with the fitness function
* Let's have a step-by-step iteration (keyboard driven) (show what are the differences)
* Figure out how to profile
* Have render the scene while trying another iteration (from father or current)?
* Check if removing a triangle gives the same fitness, then accept that new mutation
* Render test and goal images side to side

Algo related:
* Have unvisible triangles been removed. We need to add them in areas where we need more details. (splitting already existing triangles?)
